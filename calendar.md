## Calendar Challenge

#### Guidelines

* Be sure to write comments and create a README 
* Provide instructions on how to run the project and any notes about your solution
* Commit your code to a public Git repository and provide us with the URL
* Feel free to use a framework. Whether that's Angular, React or plain JavaScript (ES5 or up) - use what you’re 
most comfortable with
* You can also use a starter kit like [Angular CLI][angular-cli] or [Create React app][create-react-app] to save time
* We’re most interested to see problem solving and your approach
* Keep it simple, keep it DRY, but don’t over-complicate or over engineer, comment as much as possible
* Tests would be great!

### Brief

Please create a basic calendar web app, starting with a month view - no need to store anything outside of the browser.

Here's a basic idea of what it might look like:

### TODO

*Please don't feel you have to do all of the following, just do what time allows you.*

* Ability to create a calendar **event** for a selected day and time
* Display events on the calendar in chronological order
* Handle overflow when multiple events appear on the same date
* Ability to edit events – including changing text, day and time & colour
* Ability to delete events
* Allow the user to select a colour when creating an event, and display it appropriately
* Expand the calendar to support more than the current month
